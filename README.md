## Installation

### VS Code

```sh
cd themes/vscode
npm install
npm run install:local
```

This builds and tests the extension, packages a VSIX, and installs it into your running editor without changing the version. Then pick a theme with **Preferences: Color Theme**.

### Zed

1. Open the command palette and run **zed: install dev extension**.
2. Select the `themes/zed` folder.
3. Pick a theme with **theme selector: toggle**.

### Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions` and turn on **Developer mode**.
2. Click **Load unpacked**.
3. Select a variant folder, such as `themes/chrome/zenkai-graphite`.

## Development commands

Run these from `themes/vscode`:

- `npm run build` — regenerate VS Code themes, compile runtime code, and type-check tooling.
- `npm test` — build the extension and run tests in a separate `.test-build/` directory.
- `npm run typecheck` — check runtime, tests, and shared generation tooling without emitting files.
- `npm run generate` — regenerate all targets and documentation swatches.
- `npm run package` — build, test, and create a VSIX without installing it.
- `npm run install:local` — package and install the current version into the running editor.
- `npm run version:patch` — explicitly bump the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` without creating a Git commit or tag.
- `npm run dev` — build, open an extension development host when a VS Code CLI is available, and watch runtime TypeScript. Palette or base changes require another build.

Builds never bump versions or reinstall extensions. Compiled runtime files live in `dist/`; tests and build tooling are excluded from the VSIX.

## Editing colors

All themes are generated from the shared palettes in `src/palettes/variants/` and the hand-authored Graphite inputs in `src/bases/`. Edit those sources, then regenerate everything:

```sh
cd themes/vscode
npm run generate
npm test
```

Every file under the target theme output directories is generated, including Graphite. Never edit those files directly; edit a palette or the corresponding base instead.

See [COLOR.md](COLOR.md) for the full color system: role definitions, derived colors, cross-target mappings, and how to add a new target or variant.
